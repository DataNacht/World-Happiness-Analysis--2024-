# World Happiness Analysis
A data analysis project about Global Happiness in 2024

The World Happiness Report (WHR) reviews the average of happiness in different countries around the globe. Every year since 2012 the WHR has published the research made by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, in the UK, regarding global happiness. 

The public data available on the WHR website goes from to 2006 to 2023, and being a bit of a bookworm about emotions and social sciences it raised my interest to know about how it was for Argentina and the rest of the world in that matter.

The data set was extracted from the WHR website: https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/#appendices-and-data

From a first look at the raw data, I came up with a few questions to answer:

What is the average of happiness in Argentina ?
What is the historical average of happiness in Argentina since 2012?
What is the level of positive and negative effects perceived in Argentina ?
Which was the year with lower levels of happiness?
Which was the year with higher levels of happiness?
