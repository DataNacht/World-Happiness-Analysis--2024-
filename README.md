# World Happiness Analysis
A data analysis project about Global Happiness in 2024

The World Happiness Report (WHR) reviews the average of happiness in different countries around the globe. Every year since 2012 the WHR has published the research made by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, in the UK, regarding global happiness. In order to gather the data, 1000 responses were gathered anually for each country.

This public data is available on the WHR website. It goes from 2005/2006 to 2023, and being a bit of a bookworm about emotions and social sciences it picked my interest to know about how it was for Argentina and the rest of the world in this matter.

To understand this analysis, here are the columns explained in detail:
- Country: The name of the country.
- Life Ladder: This basically measures happiness or subjective well-being. Is the national average response to the question of life evaluations: "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”. This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder, or just life ladder.
- Positive Affect: Average of three positive affect measures: laugh, enjoyment and doing interesting things in the Gallup World Poll. They are the responses to the following three questions: “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Enjoyment?”, “Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?”

The data set was extracted from the WHR website: https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/#appendices-and-data

From a first look at the raw data, I came up with a few questions to answer:

What is the average of happiness in Argentina ?

What is the historical average of happiness in Argentina since 2012?

What is the level of positive and negative effects perceived in Argentina ?

Which was the year with lower levels of happiness?

Which was the year with higher levels of happiness?
