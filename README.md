# World Happiness Analysis🌐
A data analysis project about Global Happiness in 2024

The World Happiness Report (WHR) reviews the average of happiness in different countries around the globe. Every year since 2012 the WHR has published the research made by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, in the UK, regarding global happiness. In order to gather the data, 1000 responses were gathered anually for each country.

This public data is available on the WHR website. It goes from 2005/2006 to 2023, and being a bit of a bookworm about emotions and social sciences it picked my interest to know about how it was for Argentina and the rest of the world in this matter.

To understand this analysis, here are the columns explained in detail:
- Country: The name of the country.
- Life Ladder: This basically measures happiness or subjective well-being. Is the national average response to the question of life evaluations: "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”. This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder, or just life ladder.
- Positive affect: The average of three positive affect measures: laugh, enjoyment and doing interesting things in the Gallup World Poll (GWP). They are the responses to the following three questions: “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Enjoyment?”, “Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?”.
- Negative affect: The average of three negative affect measures in GWP. They are worry, sadness and anger, respectively the responses to “Did
you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Worry?”, “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Sadness?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Anger?”. 

The data set was extracted from the WHR website: https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/#appendices-and-data

From a first look at the raw data, I came up with a few questions to answer:

1.What was the level of happiness in each country in the world last year?

2.What was the level of happiness in Argentina last year?

3.What is the evolution of happiness in Argentina registered until 2023?

4.Which were the top five years with more happiness in Argentina?

5.Which were the top five years with less happiness in Argentina?

6.When was the maximum levels of happiness registered in Argentina?

7.When was the minimum levels of happiness registered in Argentina?

8.When was the lowest levels of positive effect registered in Argentina?

9.When was the year with more positive feelings in Argentina?

10.When was the year with more negative thoughs and feelings in Argentina?

11.When was the year with less negative thoughs and feelings in Argentina?
